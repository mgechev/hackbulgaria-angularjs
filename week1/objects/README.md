# Object hierarchy

Extend the "abstract class" `Filter` by creating:

1. Object using the object literal syntax.
2. Object using the module pattern. Implement the method `applyFilter` as private and export it in the public interface.
3. Constructor function.

Make sure you call the base constructor function with the appropriate context in order to pass the `id` argument.

You may need to make slight modification in the `app.js` file in order to add filter using the method `addVideo` of the `Video` instances.
